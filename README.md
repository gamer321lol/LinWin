# LinWin
LinWin is a linux simulator for Windows.






# Notes
You MUST run this in a cmd window, runnning this from windows explorer will just make it close after CMDS run.\  
This CANNOT run Linux apps. This is a simulator, not emulator. But i do hope to make an appstore with linux app ports!

# Installation
Download the repo as ZIP, extract and open CMD, goto the folder you extracted it in and run "load.bat"
